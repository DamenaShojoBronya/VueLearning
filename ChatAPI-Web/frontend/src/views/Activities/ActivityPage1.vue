                <p>On Saturday, June 17, 2023, we’re running our first <a
                        href="https://www.ycombinator.com/events/summerconf2023"><strong>YC Summer Conference</strong></a>,
                    a one-day event in<strong> </strong>Mountain View, CA for undergraduate and graduate students interested
                    in startups. If you've thought about starting a startup someday, this event is for you.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Garry Tan, President &amp; CEO of Y Combinator and successful startup founder, will start with a keynote
                    talk. We'll have several YC founders who started companies during college and built billion dollar
                    companies talk about how they did it. You'll learn how they got started, what went wrong, what surprised
                    them, and what happened as their companies grew.</p>
                <p>Then we'll split up into small groups with talks from recent YC founders who graduated just a couple of
                    years ago and are already running successful startups. You'll get to meet them in small groups and form
                    a genuine connection.</p>
                <p>This is also a great opportunity to meet like-minded students, maybe even your future co-founder.</p>
                <p>Because we have more interest than we have room to accommodate, we're asking people to apply to attend.
                </p>
